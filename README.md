**RUBY'S ADVENTURE 2D (Demo)** 

The purpose of this game is to repair all the broken robots throwing them a screw. If they are broken, they will hurt you if you touch them, but they won't if you repair them. You start with 5 points of health which could decrease if you hit an enemy or enter in a damage zone, but you can recover health getting collectibles from the ground.

Apart from the things I learnt from the tutorial, I also decided to include a menu in order to allow the player to pause the game, resume, restart, quit and mute audio.
